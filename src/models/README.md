# Models

This folder contains data models and TypeScript interfaces for the weather application.

## Files

- `weather.model.ts` - Weather data interfaces for Open-Meteo API responses
- `theme.model.ts` - Theme type definitions and color interfaces
- `location.model.ts` - Location and country data types

## Architecture

Models are pure data structures with no business logic. They define the shape of data flowing through the application and ensure type safety.
